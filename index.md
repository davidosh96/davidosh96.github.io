title: Programming for Geographic Inforamtion Analysts - Project Homepage
---

## Hello World... 
Welcome to my project homepage for the first assessment in the Programming for Geographic Analysts - Core Skills module. This web portfolio was created to present my first finished program since beginning to learn programming. In the future I may keep this page updated with my other work.  

### Bio
My name is David O'Shaughnessy, I am currently studying towards an MSc in Geographic Information Systems at the University of Leeds. I am primarily interested in the study and application of Geographic Information Systems in environmental contexts.

### The Project
The aim of this project was to begin learning the Python programming language and use this to create an agent-based model which displays environmental data and shows a number of agents (i.e sheep?) moving through the environment and "eating" the data.
