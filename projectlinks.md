### The Project
On this page you will find the work I have completed as part of Assessment 1 of the Programming for Geographic Information Analysts module. 

[**Click here**](https://github.com/davidosh96/Assessment_1) to view the repository for my finished model and its associated documents.
The repo contains four text files:
* The model itself - (explanation?)
* Agentframework.txt - module/object/etc to be used with the program (what it does?)
* Licence.txt - A licence for the software source code
* README.txt - contains an explanation of the source code and instructions for running the program 






Alternatively, view an [**editable preview**](https://davidosh96.github.io/modelpreview.html) of the code before downloading the finished version.


Finally, you can view the step by step progress of my model as it developed each week by visiting my
[**Model development history**](https://github.com/davidosh96/Assessment_1_Development) repo.
