On this page you will find the work I have completed as part of Assessment 1 of the Programming for Geographic Information Analysts module. 

[Click here](https://github.com/davidosh96/Assessment_1) to view the repository for my finished model and its associated documents.
The repo contains four text files:
-The model itself - (explanation?)
-Agentframework.txt - module/object/etc to be used with the program (what it does?)
-Licence.txt - A licence for the software source code
-README.txt - contains an explanation of the source code and instructions for running the program 


To view the licence for this code, [click here]()




Alternatively, view an [editable preview](https://davidosh96.github.io/modelpreview.html) of the code before downloading the finished version.
