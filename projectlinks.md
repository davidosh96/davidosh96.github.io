## The Project
On this page you will find the work I have completed as part of Assessment 1 of the Programming for Geographic Information Analysts module. 

[**Click here**](https://github.com/davidosh96/Assessment_1) to view the GitHub repository for my finished model to be assessed and its associated documents.
The repo contains four files:
* Model.py - The program itself
* Agentframework.py - module containing an Agent class, to be used with the model
* README.txt - contains an explanation of the program source code and instructions for running it
* Licence.txt - A licence for the software source code






Alternatively, view an editable [**online version**](https://davidosh96.github.io/modelpreview.html) of the code embedded on this site (a more simple version with most comments removed, not my final assessed model), before downloading the finished version.


[**Click here**](https://github.com/davidosh96/davidosh96.github.io) to view the repo for this website.

Finally, you can view the step by step progress of my model as it developed each week by visiting my
[**Model development history**](https://github.com/davidosh96/Assessment_1_Development) repository.
